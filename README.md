A helper Docker image that has all the software for running [LucPod workshops](https://github.com/lucpod) pre-installed

The image comes with the following software pre-installed:

  - Docker:    `18.03.0-ce`
  - Node.js:   `6.10.3`
  - NPM:       `3.10.10`
  - Python:    `2.7.12`
  - PIP:       `9.0.3`
  - Go:        `1.10`
  - SAM local: `snapshot`
  - AWS CLI:   `1.14.68`

This way you don't have to install all of those manually in your machine!


## üëá Pull the image

To pull the image from Docker Hub run:

```bash
docker pull lucpod/workshop
```

Sit tight and be patient, when the download finish you can use the docker image!


## ü§û Use the image

The simplest way to use the image is to just run:

```bash
docker run -it lucpod/workshop
```

This will start a Docker container in interactive mode with a bash console ready to be used.
In this console you will have access to all the afore mentioned software.

In reality you will need to tweak the Docker container config a bit in order to be
fully operative for the workshops, so keep reading the following sections!
